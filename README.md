# <img src="public/logo.png" width="50" /> Anime Archive

Anime Archive is a web application developed in React and Python, designed to serve as a tool for reformatting anime watchlist data from "Zoro.to" proxies to improve readability. This app provides users with the capability to store their anime progress offline for personal use.

## Motivation

Anime enthusiasts often use My Anime List to keep track of their watched shows and progress. However, there may be times when you want to keep a local copy of your anime list data. Anime Archive aims to bridge that gap by providing an easy-to-use solution for managing and formatting anime progress data.

## Features

- **Offline Progress Tracking**: Store your anime progress data locally, even without an internet connection.

- **Export to File**: Save your anime progress as a raw file on your computer for personal use or backup.
